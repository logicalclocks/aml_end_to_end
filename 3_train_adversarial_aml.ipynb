We will train our model using standard Python and Scikit-learn, although it could just as well be trained with other machine learning frameworks such as PySpark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. We will also show some of the exploration that can be done in Hopsworks, notably the search functions and the lineage. </span>\n",
